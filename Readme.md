# BTF APP

## Intro

    - App Developed to help with the management of a gym.

## Technologies

     - React Native for mobile app development.
     - Database:- SQLlite.

## Description

- Since majority of the app is aimed at management of the gym, i.e, the day to day activities of the gym/fitness center. Here, I eventually want to provide offline capabilities and online backups when **online**.

## Features

- Membership Management.
  - Each fitness has members, either daily or monthly clients. Offline capabilities will be effective at this point.
- Subscription Management.
  - Members have varying subscriptions which vary based on the various kinds of memberships.
- Equipment Management.
  - Have a record of the various equipment and the amount of damage and the last time they were serviced.
- Fitness Groups and Times Management.
  - Groups of people arrive at the fitness center at different times.
